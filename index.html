	<h1>PennApps Travel Guidelines</h1>

<div class="travel-text">
	If you've been accepted to PennApps X, please refer to the guidelines below when purchasing travel tickets:
	<ul>
		<li>We are only reimbursing the cheapest form of transport to Philly that we’ve deemed convenient. Please refer the “Travel Method” section of your application for the cheapest form we have found. If you find cheaper, please book that!</li>
		<li>Purchase your ticket as soon as possible. Note that we will only reimburse up to the price provided in the “Travel Budget” section. The longer you wait to book your tickets, the more the prices will go up. However, if you book immediately and the cheapest price is more expensive than the one listed on our document, please email us at <a class="travel" href="mailto:travel@pennapps.com">travel@pennapps.com</a>.</li>
		<li>Once you have made your booking, we will not cover any change fees.</li>
		<li>We will not cover any unnecessary travel fees, such as an upgrade to business class, food bought on the plane, et cetera.</li>
		<li>If you know other people who have been accepted to PennApps coming from the same location, it would be advantageous to have one person book the tickets for everyone. This will make the travel reimbursement process easier. If possible, have this person be an US citizen.</li>
		<li>We will not cover the cost of transportation to/from the PHL airport or train station. The 30th Street train station is a few blocks from the hacking location and should be walkable. The cheapest way to get to campus from the airport is SEPTA’s Airport Line Regional Rail (currently an $8 ticket).</li>
		<li>If you need to make unusual travel reservations, such as leaving late on Friday to avoid missing a class, we will not cover any fees exceeding the budget indicated that you may incur.</li>
		<li>You should anticipate arriving by 4 PM on Friday, September 12th and leaving after 5 PM on Sunday, September 14th. If you cannot book travel for Sunday night, we will try to find a place for you to sleep that night so you can leave Monday morning. You should absolutely try to find accommodations on your own if possible (such as staying with a Penn friend).</li>
		<li>If you research transportation from your location and find the travel cap to be unreasonable, feel free to contest it with us by emailing <a class="travel" href="mailto:travel@pennapps.com">travel@pennapps.com</a>.</li>
